TasteHub is a full-stack web project based on restaurant management and food related services where anyone can buy foods, add food experience to the gallery page.

# If you want to test it on your local machine
- At first, you have to clone the server-side project repo, so you have to open a terminal in the directory where you want to clone the project.
- Give the command "git clone 'your repo clone link" in the terminal.
- Then you have to clone the client-side repo of this project and just like before clone it in that directory where the client repo has been cloned.
- After finishing all repos clone to the project directory, then open the terminal.
- In your both client and server terminals write 'npm i' for installing dependencies.
- At last, give the command 'npm start' to the server side integrated terminal it will start a localhost server on port 5000. Then you have to give the command 'npm run dev' in the client side integrated terminal and go to the link 'http://localhost:5173', then you should see this web project running on your local machine.
